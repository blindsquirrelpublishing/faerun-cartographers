# Fantasy Trade and Transportation Map

## When to use
Existing travel corridors, cargo flows and distance evidence. Use when asked to produce, restyle, compare, or extract this type of fantasy map, especially in Faerûn.

## Inputs
- A user-designated authoritative base map or authoritative geometry/layers (required for factual maps).
- Optional official secondary maps, annotations, historical dates, relevant records, and requested projection or crop.
- Optional visual-style references; do not use illustrations as geographic truth.

## Style and production rules
Draw only sourced roads, routes, waterways, bridges, ferries and shipping lanes; distinguish physical roads from economic trade flows. If records provide origin/destination volumes, overlay flows on supported lines only; label goods or route use only when sourced. Include travel distance/time/cost labels only when computed from valid scale/network data or supplied records.

## Special validation rules
- A modeled trading relationship does not prove a physical roadway exists.
- Preserve road network topology and no-connect junctions.
- Sea lanes are overlays, not necessarily mapped roads; mark as derived if modeled.
- Do not invent inns, ports, caravans, flows, costs or travel times.

## Source integrity contract (required for every output)
1. Identify and rank the supplied authoritative sources before drawing. Latest user-designated official/source map controls the crop, feature positions and route geometry. Secondary maps may clarify names and dates, not silently replace geometry.
2. Keep the **exact region, area, or floor extent** shown by the user; do not fill outside the map. Treat blank/unknown as unknown, not as permission to invent.
3. Trace rivers, tributaries, coastlines, roads, paths, trails, tracks, crossings and junctions **only where source material supports them**. Preserve endpoints, turns, classifications and non-connections. Never invent a connecting line.
4. Reuse source-supported settlements, landforms, walls, gates, bridges, ruins and other sites in their proper positions. A named bridge or road junction is not automatically a town.
5. Separate mapped facts from inferred/schematic items. If a date, height, border, route, ownership or terrain class cannot be verified, show it as unknown or omit it. Do not fabricate scales, units, intervals or coordinates.
6. If multiple reference maps conflict, stop and flag important conflicts rather than averaging their shapes. Make a feature inventory and comparison checklist before rendering.
7. After drawing, visually compare the final map with source(s): same extent, topology, features, labels and spelling. Fix extra/missing/moved elements. Treat earlier AI-made maps only as **style references**, never geographic evidence.

## Shared map data / skill compatibility
May take a GIS map, georeferenced drawing, linework, vector layers, annotated raster, or plain reference image from the user's Fantasy GIS Cadastral Map, Fantasy Map to GIS Converter, Fantasy Topographic Survey, Illustrated Town Atlas, Regional Area Map or scenic skills. Keep a clean reusable set of source-controlled layers (water, relief, vegetation, routes, settlements, labels) where available. Do not assume missing layers exist.

## Handoff / delivery
Provide the finished requested visual or structured map file when feasible, plus a short list of **sources used**, **estimated/unknown details**, and **checks performed**. Do not label a decorative drawing GIS-accurate or measured without valid underlying data.


## Output quality checklist
- [ ] Style fits **Fantasy Trade and Transportation Map**.
- [ ] Exact same extent as source.
- [ ] All provided relevant features and names retained and correctly spelled.
- [ ] No invented road, path, river, bridge, settlement, border or site.
- [ ] Numeric measurements and periods supported by input or clearly marked unknown.
- [ ] Geometry and route connections compared against base reference.
- [ ] Map symbols, line types and legend are clear and consistent.
